# ZenEdge

## Project Description

ZenEdge is an NFT platform that mints AI-generated art, merging Zen-inspired serenity with futuristic tech. Its dark black and glowing white aesthetic shines through a sleek "ZenEdge" logo and dynamic metadata—like "ZenEdge AI #1" and glowing image URLs—crafted via a custom Solidity contract. With no external dependencies, it supports minting, ownership, and metadata updates for unique collectibles. Targeting NFT collectors and tech-art enthusiasts, ZenEdge aims to launch 1,000 pieces, offering a minimalist yet bold experience. It redefines digital art with AI creativity and blockchain, delivering a tranquil, innovative edge in a striking visual package.
